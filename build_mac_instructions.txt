# Build macOS Executable Instructions

Follow these steps to build a standalone executable for this project on macOS (including structure.json):

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can check by running:
   
   python3 --version

2. Install PyInstaller (if not already installed):
   
   pip3 install pyinstaller

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd /****/Project-Folder-Manager

4. Run the following command to build the executable using the macOS spec file:
   
   pyinstaller main_mac.spec

5. After the build completes, the standalone executable and the included project_folder_structure.json will be located in the `dist/main` folder inside your project directory:
   
   dist/main/main
   dist/main/project_folder_structure.json

6. To run the executable:
   
   ./dist/main/main
